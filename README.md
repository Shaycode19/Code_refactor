<H1>Code Reactor </h1>

This project consists of a code refactor. The task at hand was to fixed the accessibilty for the Horiseon website without changing 
Fixed broken links and consolidated HTML elements and CSS.

Multiple classes with the same css effects were grouped together which was simple to amend.
Other changes distorted the layout of the webpage e.g the aside section. In the end i changed the HTML semantics and the CSS classes and kept information the same. 

I couldnt get the nevigation bar text to go in the actual block and align right so 

CSS reduced from 199 lines of code to 134 with comments.

The images attached are  of the website for website accesibility
